It uses a declarative component based paradigm for building UIs easily and quickly. It\u2019s written entirely in Kotlin and embraces the style and ergonomics of the Kotlin language. Compose by example Jetpack Compose is a new declarative UI toolkit built for the demands of creating modern user interfaces. Get started with Compose and learn about the new APIs and Material components that make up the toolkit by examining concrete UIs we\u2019ve created with it. We\u2019ll walk through examples of theming, animation, layout and more, demonstrating how to customize and combine components to build real UIs. We\u2019ll show how the new toolkit simplifies your development experience and enables new possibilities. Compose for existing apps Jetpack Compose is now in alpha and you might want to start adding it to your existing apps. In this talk, you\u2019ll learn how to do that! We\u2019ll cover topics such as: adding Compose to your existing Views and embedding Views in Compose, using your existing View theme and current app architecture in Compose, testing all of that code, and much more. Jetpack Compose Jetpack Compose is Android\u2019s new modern UI toolkit. Learn how Compose simplifies & accelerates your UI development, allowing you to create richer, more robust and responsive UIs. We outline our roadmap, what is ready for use right now, share our direction in areas that are still evolving, and show how the tight integration with tooling makes the development experience even better. Get up to speed with Compose and how it can help you to build better apps! droidcon Online 2020: Become A Composer By Brian Gardner KotlinConf 2019: The Compose Runtime, Demystified by Leland Richardson Jetpack Compose is an ambitious multi-team effort to reimagine Android\u2019s UI Toolkit more than 10 years after the Android Platform launched with the original UI Toolkit. Compose follows a declarative programming model, and the runtime is coupled with a Kotlin compiler plugin to enable a novel new approach to declarative programming. In this talk, Leland will go over the mechanics of how the Compose runtime and compiler plugin work together, demystifying how it can be used to enable efficient and performant user interfaces. In addition, this talk will describe how Compose can operate completely independent of the Android Platform and Compose UI, allowing it to be used as a general language feature for Incremental Computing and the management of tree-like data structures.

In this example, every time the TextField changes, the new text value will be saved in a state and set to the TextField and the Text.","title":"Handle changes to a TextField"},{"location":"desktop/overview/","text":"Compose on Desktop \u00b6 JetBrains released a Compose port for the desktop. \u201cCompose for Desktop targets the JVM, and supports high-performance, hardware-accelerated UI rendering on all major desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux/x64) by leveraging the powerful native Skia graphics library.\u201d You can find more information here https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/ or on their Github Repo https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb or in the Kotlin Slack #compose-desktop","title":"Overview"},{"location":"desktop/overview/#compose-on-desktop","text":"JetBrains released a Compose port for the desktop. \u201cCompose for Desktop targets the JVM, and supports high-performance, hardware-accelerated UI rendering on all major desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux/x64) by leveraging the powerful native Skia graphics library.\u201d You can find more information here https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/ or on their Github Repo https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb or in the Kotlin Slack #compose-desktop","title":"Compose on Desktop"},{"location":"desktop/general/Image/","text":"Image \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Image_And_Icons_Manipulations","title":"Image"},{"location":"desktop/general/Image/#image","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Image_And_Icons_Manipulations","title":"Image"},{"location":"desktop/general/gettingstarted/","text":"Getting Started \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Getting_Started","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"desktop/general/gettingstarted/#getting-started","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Getting_Started","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"desktop/general/keyboard/","text":"Keyboard \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Keyboard","title":"Keyboard"},{"location":"desktop/general/keyboard/#keyboard","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Keyboard","title":"Keyboard"},{"location":"desktop/general/mouse/","text":"Mouse \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Mouse_Events","title":"Mouse"},{"location":"desktop/general/mouse/#mouse","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Mouse_Events","title":"Mouse"},{"location":"desktop/general/scrollbar/","text":"Scrollbar \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Desktop_Components#scrollbars","title":"Scrollbar"},{"location":"desktop/general/scrollbar/#scrollbar","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Desktop_Components#scrollbars","title":"Scrollbar"},{"location":"desktop/general/window/","text":"Window \u00b6 WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Window_API_new","title":"Window"},{"location":"desktop/general/window/#window","text":"WIP You can find the official docs here: https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/tutorials/Window_API_new","title":"Window"},{"location":"foundation/basictextfield/","text":"BasicTextField \u00b6 BasicTextField can be used to insert text.

You can then use the setContent() from the TestRule to host your Composable. composeTestRule . setContent { TestingExample () } 2) createAndroidComposeRule() \u00b6 @Rule @JvmField var composeTestRule : ComposeContentTestRule = createAndroidComposeRule < UiTestingDemoActivity > () You can use this when you want to start your test with a specific Activity. Interaction with Composables \u00b6 Now we want to test how the Composable reacts when we interact with it. Usually in Tests we would use Espresso for that, but you can use that only for classic Android Views and not for Composables. The ComposeTestRule will offer a similar API class ExampleUiTestWithAndroidComposeRule { @Rule @JvmField var composeTestRule : ComposeContentTestRule = createAndroidComposeRule < UiTestingDemoActivity > () @Test fun whenIClickOnButton_TheTextShouldChange () { composeTestRule . onNodeWithText ( \"Hello\" ). assertExists () composeTestRule . onNodeWithText ( \"Hello\" ). performClick () composeTestRule . onNodeWithText ( \"Hello\" ). assertDoesNotExist () composeTestRule . onNodeWithText ( \"Bye\" ). assertExists () } } As you can see above we used the TestRule methods to click on the node with the text Hello and asserted that the text changed to Bye The TestRule offers a lot of different methods. You can find a cheatSheet here TestTags \u00b6 The test above is only half correct, because it looks for the text inside the button and not the button itself. Composables have no resource ids so we cant just use onView(withId(R.id.my_view)) to find a Composable in a test, also we can\u2019t find Composables of a specific \u201ctype\u201d like a button, because everything is just a Composable function.
