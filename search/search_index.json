Compose by example Jetpack Compose is a new declarative UI toolkit built for the demands of creating modern user interfaces. Get started with Compose and learn about the new APIs and Material components that make up the toolkit by examining concrete UIs we\u2019ve created with it. We\u2019ll walk through examples of theming, animation, layout and more, demonstrating how to customize and combine components to build real UIs. We\u2019ll show how the new toolkit simplifies your development experience and enables new possibilities. Compose for existing apps Jetpack Compose is now in alpha and you might want to start adding it to your existing apps. In this talk, you\u2019ll learn how to do that! We\u2019ll cover topics such as: adding Compose to your existing Views and embedding Views in Compose, using your existing View theme and current app architecture in Compose, testing all of that code, and much more. Jetpack Compose Jetpack Compose is Android\u2019s new modern UI toolkit. Learn how Compose simplifies & accelerates your UI development, allowing you to create richer, more robust and responsive UIs. We outline our roadmap, what is ready for use right now, share our direction in areas that are still evolving, and show how the tight integration with tooling makes the development experience even better.

Compose follows a declarative programming model, and the runtime is coupled with a Kotlin compiler plugin to enable a novel new approach to declarative programming. In this talk, Leland will go over the mechanics of how the Compose runtime and compiler plugin work together, demystifying how it can be used to enable efficient and performant user interfaces. In addition, this talk will describe how Compose can operate completely independent of the Android Platform and Compose UI, allowing it to be used as a general language feature for Incremental Computing and the management of tree-like data structures.

The goal is to show how common use cases with the classic Android View system, can be done with Compose. Android View Compose Button Button TextView Text EditText TextField ImageView Image LinearLayout(horizontally) Row LinearLayout(vertically) Column FrameLayout Box RecyclerView LazyColumnFor RecyclerView(horizontally) LazyRowFor Snackbar Snackbar ScrollView ScrollableRow / ScrollableColumn Layouts \u00b6 What is the equivalent of a LinearLayout? \u00b6 In Android, a LinearLayout is used to lay your widgets out linearly\u2014either horizontally or vertically. With Compose, use the Row or Column composable to achieve the same result. If you notice the two code samples are identical with the exception of the \u201cRow\u201d and \u201cColumn\u201d composable. The children are the same and this feature can be exploited to develop rich layouts that can change overtime with the same children. @Composable fun Example () { Row { Text ( \"Hello World!\" ) Text ( \"Hello World!2\" ) } } @Composable fun Example () { Column { Text ( \"Hello World!\" ) Text ( \"Hello World!2\" ) } } What is the equivalent of a RelativeLayout? \u00b6 A RelativeLayout lays your widgets out relative to each other. In Compose, there are a few ways to achieve the same result. You can achieve the result of a RelativeLayout by using a combination of Column, Row, and Stack widgets What is the equivalent of a ScrollView? \u00b6 In Android, use a ScrollView to lay out your widgets\u2014if the user\u2019s device has a smaller screen than your content, it scrolls. In Compose, you can use a ScrollableColumn @Composable fun ScrollableColumnExample () { ScrollableColumn { //Only one child is allowed in a ScrollableColumn Column { for ( i in 0. . 100 ) { Text ( \" $ i Hello World!\" , style = ( MaterialTheme . typography ()). body1 ) } } } } What is the equivalent of a RecyclerView? \u00b6 In Compose, you can use a LazyColumn or LazyRow . What is the equivalent of wrap_content? \u00b6 In the classic Android View system you use wrap_content to set the height/width of a View to the minimun needed value.
